Trevius: (Secrets/Trevius) Added 2 new fields (maxlevel & scalerate) to npc_types for allowing NPCs to spawn within a range of levels and scale stats at the rate set
WildcardX: NPC is no longer a friend class in the Mob class. Moved the class member Mob::target to Mob's private scope to ensure other classes use the Mob::GetTarget() and Mob::SetTarget() methods.
WildcardX: *BOTS* Commented out code that let bots use the groups chat channel until I can fix I bug I found that causes bots to have their targets repeatedly reset to null values and back to their attacker while in combat.

Required SQL: utils/sql/svn/898_npc_maxlevel_scalerate.sql

WildcardX: *BOTS* Modified the IsBotAttackAllowed() method to prevent a bot wizard's familiar from attacking.
WildcardX: *BOTS* More code refactoring. Bots will now use group message channel to communicate with the group (idea being bots may eventually be in a different zone than the group and/or client).

Optional SQL: *BOTS* utils/sql/svn/892_optional_bots_table_mod.sql
Optional SQL: *BOTS* utils/sql/svn/893_optional_bots_table_mod.sql

KLS: Added #path move and #path disconnect all.

==7/24/2009==

WildcardX: (for BOTS alpha code only) Set textures to 0 to create the correct appearance of a naked bot on spawn without any equipment.
AndMetal: Changed AA Effects to be loaded into a map instead of a static array.
AndMetal: Changed weight in the client class to uint32 from int16 since the client uses 32 bits for the weight. This should prevent it from overflowing.
AndMetal: Corrected Packrat from 10% per level to 1% per level per the Titanium client. It also now affects coin weight (also 1% per level) per the Titanium client.
AndMetal: Cleaned up a few compile warnings.

==07/10/2009==
Trevius: (Zeice) Added #mystats command as an alternative to #showstats that only shows stats for the client or it's own pet.

KLS: Fix for fear not wearing off properly.
KLS: Small tweaks to npc spell ai.
KLS: SoF - Raids should now function properly.

==07/09/2009==

KLS: Backstab will now use the backstab damage field from items instead of weapon damage.
KLS: Redid all combat skill ups, can only skill up against light blue targets or better for offensive and defensive actions, wont work against clients or NPCs who don't have aggro lists.
KLS: Mobs will prefer targets who are not feared to targets who are feared when selecting new targets.

==07/06/2009==
KLS: Reworked EVENT_ATTACK to be more efficient.
KLS: Reworked EVENT_COMBAT to be both more efficient and smoother, no longer having an arbitrary delay before it fires.
KLS: Took out code in HateList::IsEmpty() that no longer makes any sense to me, it should be noticably faster.
KLS: Took out old unused quest::flagnpc stuff.
KLS: Added #netstats command, allows GM to view the network sent/recv & sent/recv per second on their target or themselves.
WildcardX: Migrated more code from EQBOTS to BOTS and reworked BOTS to derive from NPC object instead of Mob.

AndMetal: AAs are now calculated in CalcBonuses for clients.
          AAs that have been converted: (Advanced) Innate STR / STA / AGI / DEX / INT / WIS / CHA, Innate Enlightenment, Natural Durability, Physical Enhancement, Planar Durability, Packrat. They should already be in the PEQ aa_effects table.
          For new AAs, you'll want to modify the StatBonuses struct in zone/mob.h. You'll also need to add a case in ApplyAABonuses in zone/bonuses.cpp to add it to aabonuses.
AndMetal: (via Congdar) Fix for quest::traindiscs().
AndMetal: Fixed Packrat. However, it doesn't seem to be updating correctly to the client (or we're taking too much off).
AndMetal: Added weight to #showstats, accurate to 1 decimal point.
KLS: NPCs will no longer try to base their attack speed off weapons they're using, the code wasn't working anyway.
KLS: Lowered monk kick damage and damage table bonuses but added rules to govern this damage so they can be boosted up for any servers that want.
KLS: More work on ranged damage for npcs, not yet fully implemented but quest functions can cause NPCs to ranged attack.
KLS: Added quest::IsEffectInSpell(spell_id, effect_id), quest::IsBeneficialSpell(spell_id), quest::GetSpellResistType(spell_id), quest::GetSpellTargetType(spell_id)

==07/03/2009==
KLS: Fix for AA reuse timer text.

KLS: Redid inner workings of rampage a bit to be more efficient memory wise and to hold an unlimited number of rampage targets instead of capping at 20.
KLS: Made ranged combat stuff virtual so I can implement npc ranged attacks tomorrow.
KLS: Added 3 perl functions for the mob scalar type: SetEntityVariable(id_num, var), GetEntityVariable(id_num) and EntityVariableExists(id_num), taking int32 for id_num and string for var. Allows someone to store as many variables on the entity being targeted as they would like.

==07/02/2009==
KLS: Berserker NPCs will now frenzy instead of kick.
KLS: Fix for GetHateRandom() method crash if there are 0 people on the hate list.

AndMetal: Switched to some more Message String IDs.
AndMetal: quest::scribespells can now accept minimum level as a 2nd argument. Examples: quest::scribespells(60,60) will scribe just level 60 spells, quest::scribespells(75,71) will scribe spells from 71 through 75.
AndMetal: Ditto with #scribespells, quest::traindiscs, & #traindiscs.
AndMetal: quest::scribespells & quest::traindiscs will now return the amount of spells/disciplines that were scribed/learned (an optional way to verify success or failure).
AndMetal: #scribespells & #traindiscs will limit the max level to whatever the rule Character:MaxLevel is set to, unless you have GM Mode turned on, in which case it's limited to 255 (uint8).
AndMetal: Fixed a compile error introduced in Rev 729.
gaeorn: SE_Harmony and SE_ChangeFrenzyRad effects were reversed. This is based on info from alla regarding spells post OoW that only have SE_Harmony effect (reaction radius).
KLS: Added NPC code 'd' to make npcs be able to see through feign death attempts. (mostly implemented, still have to look into aggroing people who are feigned by proximity)
KLS: Fixed a typo in the petition code and un-reverted the petition.h file (hi, there's a reason it was changed).
KLS: Added mob perl object HealDamage(amount, caster = 0);

==06/30/2009==

realityincarnate: Added $client->SetStartZone and $client->GetStartZone perl commands. 
KLS: Petitions will assign id based on character id instead of this stupid desyncing junk.
KLS: Max NPC name length increased to 50 characters up from 30.
KLS: Save on zone success will now commit immediately instead of possibly delaying. Hopefully will help with some of the situations where people zone to bad locations.
gaeorn: New rule NPC:SmartLastFightingDelayMoving. When true (default), if a mob is already wandering home during a FD pull and the puller stands up and then FD again, the mob's timer to return home will not reset, but instead will return home immediately. The timer will be reset if the mob forgets about the FD puller.
gaeorn: New rule Combat:AssistNoTargetSelf. When assisting a target without a target: true = target self (default), false = leave target as was before assist (this is the behavior on live).

Required SQL: \utils\sql\svn\665_heroic_resists.sql
Required SQL: utils/sql/svn/667_titles.sql

Recommended SQL: (This is recommended for databases that don't stay current with PEQ or are custom)
UPDATE items SET backstabdmg = damage WHERE backstabdmg = 0 AND itemtype = 2;

Warning: If you do not have a spells_new table yet, you must create one and load spells into it or zones will crash when loading in.
	 To create the spells_new table, use the SQL from \utils\sql\svn\230_spells_table.sql
	 After creating the table, you can import or export your spells from the spells_us.txt file by using the scripts:
	 import_spells.pl
	 export_spells.pl
	 
	 The easiest way to import your spell file to the table is to move the import_spells.pl file to your main server directory
	 where your spells_us.txt file and your eqemu_config.xml file are.  Then run the following command at a command prompt:
	 perl import_spells.pl

See this post for more information on importing/exporting the spell file:

KLS: Hopefully fix for pets not giving adventure credit to players in ldon instances.

==06/07/2009==
NOTE (WildcardX): This version of the server code is a little dangerous for BOT enabled servers. I do not recommend using this revision for BOT enabled servers. Most of the existing BOT code is going to be re-implemented as a "BOT" object in the server code so until I complete this architecture change the BOT code may become somewhat unstable. I apologize for the inconvience but this is necessary to allow the server code for the BOTs to be more flexible and extensible than it is now.
